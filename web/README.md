# The Web-App

The LHR-Net website is a `React` webapp created with `npx create vite@latest`.
`Tailwind` is used for styling and the `ONNX` runtime for machine learning inference.

# Deployment

The website is setup to auto-deploy to cloudflare pages on push to `main`. There is also
the capability of preview builds for other branches (which can be configured when needed).

The `main` deployment is available at [lhr.billyedmoore.com](lhr.billyedmoore.com).
